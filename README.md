# Tiny Neural Network - TNN
TNN is a Nerual Network Library written in rust. TNN is primarity a toy project for me to learn how neural networks work in-depth as well as get some hands on experience with rust and GPU level optimization.

## TNN-EXAMPLES 
Read the examples provided in this crate to understand how the network works

## TNN-CORE
These contain the core components of the neral network
    - Tensors

## TNN-NN
## TNN-OPTIM
